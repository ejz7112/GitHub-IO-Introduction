## About Me

I'm Ethan Zientek, I'm a first year software engineering student from Williamsville. I attented Williamsville South High School, I was the salutorian in my class. I'm not a big sports guy or a big hobby man. I mainly just hang out with my friends, play video games, and watch YouTube. My favorite colors are green and pink and I'm just happy to be here.
